# Foundry Smart Contract Project

This project uses Foundry for Ethereum smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Smart contract source files
- `test/` - Test files using Foundry's testing framework
- `script/` - Deployment and utility scripts
- `lib/` - External dependencies and libraries
- `foundry.toml` - Foundry configuration file

## Development Guidelines

- Write contracts in Solidity following best practices
- Use Foundry's testing framework for comprehensive test coverage
- Follow proper security practices for smart contracts
- Use proper gas optimization techniques
- Document all public functions and complex logic

## Commands

- `forge build` - Compile contracts
- `forge test` - Run tests
- `forge install` - Install dependencies
- `forge script` - Run deployment scripts
